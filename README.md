Welcome to my personal coding home! 
This repository serves as a central hub for 
documenting my coding journey and 
showcasing my progress as I learn and 
explore new technologies. Here, you will 
find an evolving collection of projects, 
code snippets, resources that reflect 
my growth as a developer.

This will also server as an up to date  backend to my website
